## Birth

**Python** programming language is conceived by Dutch software engineer - Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s. He worked at *CWI (Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica)* as a developer of programming language for educational purposes called *ABC* and *Amoeba* operating system. 

In December 1989, Guido van Rossum was looking for something to do during the upcoming Christmas holidays. He decided to start  building interpreter for the new programming language that inherited features of *ABC* excluding it's problems. In the first version of the language he created basic syntax that uses *indentation* for grouping instead of curly brackets or begin-end statements and some useful data types including `dict`ionary (hash table), `list`, `str`ings, and numbers.

Throughout all the next year Guido van Rossum was improving the language and using it for his own purposes in *Amoeba* development.

In February 1991, he posted **Python** to [USENET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet).  

## Snake or comedy

Many of you may think that the programming language is named after the snake, even a logo has 2 snakes on it. However, the Python language is named after British comedy TV show called Monty Python. Guido van Rossum has chosen the name because short, unique and slightly misterious name were needed. 

## Core development history

First version of **Python 0.9.0** was published in *February 1991*. It included core data types listed above, functions and exception handling. Moreover, it had modules system and object oriented structure already.

**Python 1.0** was released in *January 1994*. Functional programming tools - `lambda`, `map`, `reduce`, `filter` were introduced.

In *October 2000* there was the first major update called **Python 2.0** that included list comprehensions, garbage collector and unicode support. 

Finally, on *December 3, 2008* [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf/) released **Python 3.0**. In this version, backward compatibility with Python 2 were broken and many things were totally redesigned in order to follow *"Zen of Python"* more clearly.

## Zen of Python

*"Zen of Python"* is a collection of 19 principles that have to be followed while designing computer programs on **Python** and designing Python itself. They have been written by Tim Peters and posted in Python mailing list in 1999. 

Let's meet "Zen of Python" (you can get it by executing `import this` in Python shell:

```python
>>> import this
The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
